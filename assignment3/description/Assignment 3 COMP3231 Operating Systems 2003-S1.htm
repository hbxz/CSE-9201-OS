<P>Any bonus awarded for the advanced part can be used to make up for lost marks 
in any class mark component of the course. 
<H2>Introduction</H2>In this assignment, you will extend OS/161's native file 
system (SFS) to support large files and block accounting. If you attempt the 
advanced part of the assignment, you will add support for subdirectories, thus 
enabling a hierarchical naming system. If this is not enough, you can add a 
buffer cache to OS/161 to improve performance. 
<H2>Code walk-through </H2>Bring your answers to the code walk-through questions 
to your week 12 tutorial. The OS/161 sfs file system we provide is very simple. 
The implementation resides in the fs/sfs directory. The fs/vfs directory 
provides the infrastructure to support multiple file systems. 
<H3>kern/include</H3>You should examine the files fs.h, vfs.h, vnode.h, and 
sfs.h. 
<P><EM>1. What is the difference between VOP_ routines and FSOP_ routines?</EM> 
<H3>kern/fs/vfs </H3>
<H4>device.c</H4>This implements raw device support. 
<P><EM>2. What vnode operations are permitted on devices?</EM> 
<H4>devnull.c </H4>This implements the OS/161 equivalent of /dev/null, null:. 
<H4>vfscwd.c </H4>This implements current working directory support. 
<P><EM>3. Why is VOP_INCREF called in vfs_getcurdir?</EM> 
<H4>vfslist.c</H4>This implements operations on the entire set of file systems. 
<P><EM>4. How do items get added to the vfslist?</EM> 
<H4>vfslookup.c</H4>Name translation operations. 
<H4>vfspath.c</H4>Operations on path names; implements the vfs operations. 
<H4>vnode.c</H4>Initialization and reference count management. 
<H3>kern/fs/sfs</H3>
<H4>sfs_fs.c</H4>File system routines. 
<P><EM>5. There is no buffer cache currently in sfs. However, the bitmaps and 
superblock are not written to disk on every modification. How is this 
possible?</EM> 
<P><EM>6. What do the statements in Question 5 mean about the integrity of your 
file system after a crash?</EM> 
<P><EM>7. Can you unmount a file system on which you have open files?</EM> 
<P><EM>8. List 3 reasons why a mount might fail.</EM> 
<H4>sfs_io.c</H4>Block I/O routines 
<H4>sfs_vnode.c</H4>File routines 
<P><EM>9. Why is a routine like sfs_partialio necessary? Why is this currently a 
performance problem? What part of this assignment will make it less of one.</EM> 

<P><EM>10. What is the sfs_bmap routine used for?</EM> 
<H3>sbin/mksfs</H3>Implements the mksfs utility which creates an sfs file system 
on a device. 
<H4>disk.h/disk.c</H4>Defines what the disk looks like. 
<H4>mksfs.c</H4>
<P><EM>11. What is the inode number of the root?</EM> 
<H2>Setting Up Assignment 3</H2>
<P>Follow these directions carefully!!!!! Make sure you have plenty of disk 
quota available before you start. 
<P>Download the following patch from the class web site (<A 
href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3231/assigns/os161/ass3/ass3-start.patch">ass3-start.patch</A>) 
and save it in your home directory. 
<P>We will now create a branch in your cvs repository to work on this 
assignment. <B>Make sure you get the following command correct</B>. <PRE>% cvs rtag -r os161-base -b ass3 src
</PRE>
<P>The previous cvs command creates a branch in CVS called <TT>ass3</TT>. Remove 
the <TT>src</TT> from the previous assignment (you will have a copy committed in 
your repository), and checkout a copy of this assignment to work on. <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231
% rm -rf src
% cvs checkout -r ass3 src
</PRE>Note that if in the future you wish to checkout the latest (most recently 
committed) version of your sources to this assignment, you can use the above 
command again. If you do, take care not to do it over the top of an existing 
tree. 
<P>We will now <EM>patch</EM> your checked out tree to make the changes you need 
to do this assignment. <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231/src

</PRE>You will notice we have added (A) eight files, and modified (M) 18 others. 

<P>Now commit these changes to the repository, and tag them as ass3-start. Note 
you will have to enter a log message during the commit. <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231/src
% cvs commit 
% cvs tag ass3-start
</PRE>You are now ready to start the assignment. 
<P>Note: We have included our own version of the synchronisation primitives you 
wrote in Assignment 1 and a simple implementation of the syscalls <TT>open(), 
close(), read(), write(), lseek()</TT>. You can use your own if you wish, but 
make sure that whatever base you start with is "rock solid". 
<H3>Building and Testing Your Assignment</H3>
<H4>Configure OS/161 for Assignment 3</H4>
<P>Before proceeding further, configure your new sources. <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231/src
% ./configure
</PRE>
<P>Unlike previous the previous assignment, you will need to build and install 
the user-level programs that will be run by your kernel in this assignment. <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231/src
% make
</PRE>Note: "make" in this directory does both "make" and "make install". 
<P>For your kernel development, again we have provided you with a framework for 
you to run your solutions for ASST3. 
<P>You have to reconfigure your kernel before you can use this framework. The 
procedure for configuring a kernel is the same as in ASST0, ASST1, etc, except 
you will use the ASST3 configuration file: <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231/src/kern/conf	
% ./config ASST3
</PRE>You should now see an ASST3 directory in the compile directory. 
<H4>Building for ASST3</H4>When you built OS/161 for ASST1, you ran make from 
compile/ASST1 . In ASST3, you run make from (you guessed it) compile/ASST3. <PRE>% cd ../compile/ASST3
% make depend
% make
% make install
</PRE>If you are told that the compile/ASST3 directory does not exist, make sure 
you ran config for ASST3. 
<H4>Command Line Arguments to OS/161</H4>Your solutions to ASST3 will be tested 
by running OS/161 with command line arguments that correspond to the menu 
options in the OS/161 boot menu. 
<P><B>IMPORTANT: Please DO NOT change these menu option strings!</B> 
<H4>Running "asst3"</H4>For this assignment, we have supplied a user-level 
OS/161 program that you can use for testing. It is called <TT>asst3</TT>, and 
its sources live in <TT>src/testbin/asst3</TT>. 
<P>You can test your assignment by typing <TT>p /testbin/asst3</TT> at the 
OS/161 menu prompt. <B>Note: On cygwin, you need to type <TT>p 
/testbin/asst3.exe</TT></B> 
<P>Running the program produces output similar to the following prior to 
starting the assignment. <B>You must configure sys161, and format and mount your 
disk first</B> (see below). <PRE>************************************************************

</PRE>
<H3>Configuring System/161</H3>You may need to have configured System/161 to 
have at least one disk to test your file system on. The following should be 
sufficient in your <TT>~/cs3231/root/sys161.conf</TT>. <PRE>2	disk	rpm=7200	sectors=2048	file=DISK1.img
#3	disk	rpm=7200	sectors=2048	file=DISK2.img
</PRE>These disk images are created if they don't exist on System/161 startup. 
<P>You can also increase the amount of RAM in System/161, if you need it. <PRE>31	busctl	ramsize=4194304
</PRE>
<H3>Formatting and Using Your SFS Disks</H3>Before using SFS, you need to format 
the disk on which you are going to mount the file system. This should be done on 
your host system. The following examples illustrate how to format lhd0 
(DISK1.img). 
<P>In your cs3231/root directory:</P><PRE>host% hostbin/host-mksfs DISK1.img my-vol-name
</PRE>The next time you run OS/161, you can mount SFS on the formatted disk 
device (lhd0 in this example) from the OS161 command menu: <PRE>OS/161 kernel [? for menu]: mount sfs lhd0
vfs: Mounted my-vol-name: on lhd0
</PRE>Once mounted, you can then read and write files on the file system by 
specifying the mounted device in the pathname of the open call. <PRE>open("lhd0:newfile", O_RDWR | O_CREAT);
</PRE>
<H2>Basic Assignment </H2>The following sections outline what you must do for 
the basic assignment. 
<H3>Add support for the <TT>fstat</TT> and <TT>sync</TT> system calls</H3>The 
<TT>fstat</TT> system call is applied to a valid file descriptor, and the 
following information is returned about the file. <PRE>struct stat {
	u_int32_t st_mode;	/* protection mode and file type */
	u_int32_t st_nlink;	/* number of hard links */
	off_t st_size;		/* file size (bytes) */
	u_int32_t st_blocks;	/* number of blocks file is using */
};
</PRE>You must provide the in-kernel implementation of <TT>fstat</TT> (and 
<TT>sync</TT> that works for all present (and future) vfs-based file systems. 
<P>Additionally, SFS currently only supports st_mode and st_size. You must add 
support for st_blocks within SFS. st_blocks contains the number of disk blocks 
consumed by the file on disk. 
<P>Notes: 
<UL>
  <LI>You can ignore the block used by the inode on disk in your block 
  accounting scheme. 
  <LI>You do not need to support sfs_truncate for the basic assignment, and as 
  such, your block accounting will not have to handle the case where files are 
  deleted or decrease in size. 
  <LI>The number of blocks consumed must obviously be persistent, and hence you 
  will need to modify the on-disk inode structure to store st_blocks. </LI></UL>
<H3>Adding Support for Large Files</H3>SFS only supports medium sized, 
potentially sparse, files using a scheme very similar to the UNIX inode scheme 
covered in lectures. SFS only supports <EM>direct</EM> block pointers and 
<EM>single indirect</EM> block pointers. Thus the largest file currently 
supported by SFS is (15 + 128) * 512 = 71.5 Kbytes. 
<P>You must extend SFS to support files up to 1082203648 bytes (1+ Gigabytes) by 
adding support for <EM>double indirect</EM> and <EM>triple indirect</EM> blocks 
on disk. Note that we can actually test creating files of maximum size on our 
small test disk by using lseek to write to specific locations within the file, 
thus creating a sparsely populated file. 
<P>For additional background, consult one or more of the following texts for 
details how similar existing operating systems structure their file system 
management: 
<UL>
  <LI>Section 6.4.5 and Section 10.6.3, Tannenbaum, <EM>Modern Operating Systems 
  </EM>. 
  <LI>Chapter 9, Vahalia, <EM>Unix Internals: the new frontiers</EM>. </LI></UL>
<H2>Basic Assignment Submission </H2>As with assignment 0, you again will be 
submitting a diff of your changes to the original tree. 
<P>You should first commit your changes back to the repository using the 
following command. Make sure you <TT>cvs add</TT> any new files you added to 
your kernel. Note: You will have to supply a comment on your changes. <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231/src
% cvs commit
</PRE>
<P>Now tag the repository so that you can always retrieve your current version 
in the future. <PRE>% cd ~/cs3231/src
% cvs tag ass3-finish
</PRE>
<P>Now generate a file containing the diff. <PRE>% cvs -q rdiff -r os161-base -r ass3-finish -u src &gt; ~/ass3.diff
</PRE>To check your diff file, see the <A 
href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3231/doc/subcheck.shtml">Assignment 
Submission Guidelines</A> 
<H3>Submitting Your Assignment</H3>Now submit the diff as your assignment. <PRE>% cd ~
% give cs3231 ass3 ass3.diff
</PRE>You're now done. <B>Note: If you wish to re-submit your assignment, you 
will have to re-tag the final version with a new, unique, tag (e.g. 
ass3-finish-2), and generate a new diff against this new tag.</B> 
<H2>Advanced Assignment </H2>The advanced assignment is to complete the basic 
assignment, plus the following. Note: To get the available 20%, it is not 
expected that everything that follows be implemented. The 20% is available to 
those that implement a <EM>substantial subset</EM> of the following. 
<H3>Setting Up Advanced Assignment 3</H3>
<P>Given your doing the advanced version of the assignment, I'm assuming your 
competent with managing your CVS repository and don't need simple directions. 
<P>Basically, at the end of the assignment you will need to generate a 
<TT>rdiff</TT> between your final version and os161-base. It is up to you how 
you get there. Two obvious options are: continue developing along your ass3 
branch, or create a new branch from where you finished the basic part of ass2. 
<B>Warning: don't submit a cvs diff!</B> Only submit a <B>cvs rdiff</B> as 
<TT>cvs diff</TT> generates broken patches. 
<P>An example branch <PRE>% cvs rtag -r ass3-finished  -b ass3_adv src
</PRE>
<H3>Adding support for hierarchical directories</H3>As supplied, SFS has support 
for various aspects of directories in that it supports a single directory at the 
root of the mounted file system. See the function table <TT>sfs_dirops</TT> for 
a list of supported directory operations. You should add support for the 
following system calls for vfs file systems in general, and if required, add the 
underlying support for the operations in SFS itself. 
<UL>
  <LI>mkdir, rmdir, getdirentry </LI></UL>Some things you will have to consider 
when adding hierarchical naming to SFS. 
<UL>
  <LI>If a file or directory is expected to exist by the semantics of a call, 
  and it does not, the resulting error code should be ENOENT. 
  <LI>If a file is encountered where a directory was expected, the resulting 
  error code should be ENOTDIR. 
  <LI>If a directory is encountered where a file was expected, the resulting 
  error code should be EISDIR. 
  <LI>If an operation cannot be completed because the disk is full, the 
  resulting error code should be ENOSPC. 
  <LI>If removal of a non-empty directory is attempted, the resulting error code 
  should be ENOTEMPTY. 
  <LI>As in assignment 2, when an invalid file handle is used, the resulting 
  error code should be EBADF. 
  <LI>If an attempt is made to operate in a prohibited manner upon '.' or '..', 
  the resulting error code should be EINVAL. 
  <LI>If an attempt is made to rename a directory into one of its 
  subdirectories, the resulting error code should be EINVAL. </LI></UL>Your code 
should do the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>If there is a file or directory in the top level directory named foo, 
  accept an open request for foo (the leading '/' will be removed by the vfs 
  layer). 
  <LI>If there is a directory in the top level directory named skippy and a file 
  in that directory named crunchy accept an open, create, or remove request for 
  skippy/crunchy (see comment above about leading '/' characters). 
  <LI>If there is no directory in the top level directory named smuckers it 
  should disallow the creation, open, or remove of a file named smuckers/grape. 
  <LI>Allow removal of an empty directory; disallow removal of a non-empty 
  directory. 
  <LI>Accept a directory name that ends in a / (though directory names that do 
  not end up in / are OK as well.) </LI></UL>Your code must not do the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>Assume that the user wants all the missing directories created 
  automatically when presented with a pathname that doesn’t exist, on a create. 
  For example, if there is a directory named /bim/ska/la and I mistakenly try to 
  create a file named /bum/ska/la/bim, I don’t want SFS to create the 
  directories /bum, /bum/ska, and /bum/ska/la so that it can create bim. It 
  should return an error. </LI></UL>
<H3>Add support for renaming and deleting files</H3>Implement the 
<TT>rename</TT> and <TT>remove</TT> system calls, and the underlying sfs 
implementation. 
<H3>File System Synchronisation </H3>If you implemented fork and wrote a shell 
for assignment two, you can include your implementation in the advanced part of 
this assignment and do the following. 
<UL>
  <LI>Use the user-level utilities in <TT>bin</TT> to test your assignment by 
  invoking them in your shell. 
  <LI>Potentially have concurrent access to the file system, which is NOT 
  currently handled by SFS. </LI></UL>SFS does not currently protect itself from 
concurrent access by multiple threads. For example, because there is no 
synchronization on the free block bitmap, two threads, creating files, could 
both decide to use the same free sector. Your mission is to bullet-proof the 
filesystem so that two threads can use the filesystem harmoniously. You must 
allow multiple threads to have the same file open. When this is the case, your 
filesystem needs to implement Unix filesystem semantics. 
<UL>
  <LI>Atomic Writes: file writes are atomic. If one thread has a file open for 
  writing, and a second has the same file open for reading, the second thread 
  will always be presented with a consistent view of the file with respect to 
  each write system call. On each read, returned data will be considered the 
  state of the file before a write system call started, or after the write 
  system call ended, but not what it looked like during the write. 
  <LI>Removal: if a thread has a file open, a remove of that file eliminates the 
  name in the directory immediately, but postpones actual removal of the file’s 
  contents until the file is closed by all threads that have it open (however, 
  since the name is removed fromthe directory, no other opens of the file will 
  succeed). In addition, you should guarantee that the removal of a directory 
  that is the current working directory (CWD) of some process does not cause a 
  process (or our operating system) to crash. You may choose to disallow the 
  removal or you may remove it and handle the process whose CWD was removed very 
  carefully. In UNIX, the removal succeeds, however, subsequent accesses to '.' 
  or '..' can fail for the that had the directory as its CWD. 
  <LI>Atomic Create: If two threads attempt to create a file of the same name at 
  the same time, specifying O_CREAT | O_EXCL, one should succeed, and the other 
  should fail. 
  <LI>Synchronous Directory Operations: If your system crashes after any of the 
  following operations return, the disk should be left in a state reflecting 
  that the call completed: create, remove, mkdir, rmdir. </LI></UL>An example of 
atomic write: if thread A performs a syscall to write 512 bytes to file F 
starting at location 0, and at the same time, thread B performs a syscall to 
read 256 bytes of file F starting at location 128, thread B is guaranteed that 
it will get 256 bytes of the file either before thread A’s write takes place, or 
after thread A’s write took place. It will never get back some bytes from F from 
before thread A’s write started and some from after thread A’s write ends. 
<P>An example of removal: thread C has file F open (it doesn’t matter whether 
it’s for reading or writing). Thread D performs an unlink syscall on file F. 
Thread C (and file F) are not affected by the unlink. When thread C closes file 
F, it is then deleted. 
<P>Be careful to return appropriate error codes from calls to file-related 
methods in the file system! The syscalls you implemented in assignment 2 rely on 
these values to operate correctly! 
<H3>Add a Buffer Cache </H3>You will find that the performance of SFS is not 
great. In particular, there is no buffer cache. You should add a buffer cache to 
OS/161. You will need to decide what data structures you need to implement this 
and what interface routines you will use. Figure out exactly where the buffer 
cache will interface with the rest of the system, and how you will maintain the 
integrity of your file system in the face of caching. You should have a clear 
design of your interface and data structures, your replacement algorithms, and 
any extra precautions you take to ensure the integrity of the file system. Also, 
consider any additional support necessary to make sure that buffered data 
eventually gets written to disk.
