<h3>Name</h3>
forkbomb - create hundreds of processes

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
/testbin/forkbomb

<h3>Description</h3>

forkbomb does
<pre>
   while (1) fork();
</pre>

doing a bit of additional checking similar to that done by 
<A HREF=forktest.html>forktest</A>.
<p> 

<strong>
DO NOT RUN THIS ON A REAL SYSTEM - IT WILL GRIND TO A HALT AND
PEOPLE WILL COME AFTER YOU WIELDING BASEBALL BATS AND/OR THE AD
BOARD. WE WARNED YOU.
</strong>
<p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

forkbomb uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fork.html>fork</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/getpid.html>getpid</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>

We don't expect your system to withstand forkbomb without grinding to
a halt. However, ideally, once asst2 is complete, and also once asst3
is complete, it shouldn't crash.
<p>

Note that this may turn out to be hard to achieve in practice. Don't
spend much time fixing problems forkbomb triggers that won't arise
under more normal operation. (If in doubt, consult the course staff.)
